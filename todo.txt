- Clean up assign/for loop logic around storing lhs name? Why go through name method with booleans?
- Fix hack in scope.py: _global_ident_node_registry = {}
- Get imports right (first generate boilerplate to runnable)
- Functions that return same type as first arg: sorted

- There are a few places in code where we need to know the fields of nodes. Use _fields to make this generally or centralize
- Rename strongly_typed to statically_typed
- Rename LanguageSyntax to Language[Definition]?
- Add a comment to every constant in nodeattrs
