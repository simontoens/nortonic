- asttoken token type passing isn't nice
- context.TypeInfo.metadata is not nice
- if/for etc - args vs body, these are currently compared magically:
  num_children_visited == 2 for ex (see scope pushing)
- Clean up assign/for loop logic around storing lhs name? Why go through name method with booleans?
- Functions that return same type as first arg: sorted

- Java: do not use String.format("%s") for constants
- Java: fix silly: List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(List.of());
- There are a few places in code where we need to know the fields of nodes. Use _fields to make this general or centralize
- Rename strongly_typed to statically_typed
- Rename LanguageSyntax to Language[Definition]?
- astrewriter: get rid of wrap
- readlines in python includes terminating \n in each list element?
- builtin module registration is weird, "os.path" has to be repeated


real issues:
    - support conversion methods: str(), int() etc - bonus: remove them if not needed in target language (ie Java converts implicity if lhs is a str, for exampe)
    - need a proper way to generate new indentifer names in current scope
    - "\n".join(lines) - \n needs to be escaped \\n
    - elisp: lack of rtn makes it non trivial to translate real code
    - java: in function, every branch must have a return
    - Fix hack in scope.py: _global_ident_node_registry = {}
    - need generalized "result mapping", nil -> -1 for cl-search for example
    - no continue/break in elisp dolist
    - elisp: map code doesn't work - below l1 is treated as a string
          (setq l1 (list 1 2 3))
          (setq d1 #s(hash-table test equal data ("k1" l1)))
