- register_function_rename has to consider the target type: list.append -> list.add BUT just the function append should not get renamed
- There are a few places in code where we need to know the fields of nodes. Use _fields to make this generally or centralize
- Rename strongly_typed to statically_typed
- Rename LanguageSyntax to Language[Definition]?
- Review literal_converter abstraction in syntax.py (only for bool?)
