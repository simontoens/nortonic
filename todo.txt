- cleanup:
  - subscript in FuncCallVisitor - target type
  - call in TypeVisitor - correctly register append usage to determine types added
- Can get_homogeneous_contained_type return a representation of the contained type or contained types - it is not right to ask it for a specific type - this needs to be encapsulated
- dict type
- if/for etc - args vs body, these are currently compared magically:
  num_children_visited == 2 for ex (see scope pushing)
- Clean up assign/for loop logic around storing lhs name? Why go through name method with booleans?
- Fix hack in scope.py: _global_ident_node_registry = {}
- Get imports right (first generate boilerplate to runnable)
- Functions that return same type as first arg: sorted

- Java: do not use String.format("%s") for constants
- There are a few places in code where we need to know the fields of nodes. Use _fields to make this generally or centralize
- Rename strongly_typed to statically_typed
- Rename LanguageSyntax to Language[Definition]?
- Add a comment to every constant in nodeattrs
