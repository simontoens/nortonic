fix nodeattrs atts vs metadata.  everything should be passed as node metadata
but we don't need a dict, these can all be attrs internally
elisp: review spacing in test_loop.py: (list(list "bye" "world")
golang: &names[1] is valid, no need to get the element first

- can we generalize the function instance attached to the node to the type info
it returns? Most places in code only care about the function rtn type?
- should lookup_type_info check the node if dict doesn't have it?
- determine if all type infos should only be set on nodes (can't because some need to be overridden but other don't, because of pointers? - can this be explicit?)
Add test that only adds to list in method, list is passed into method
fix space before comma: return strings.Split(gav[i + 1:] , " ")[0]
todo: test_misc for golang
todo: rename TARGET_DEREF
testfile for golang
"is not" support please
TODO golang and nil assignment, reg_type_mapping should take a "unset_value"? (defaulted to None) - but for methods, we probably need to return pointers so that callsite None (->nil) checks work
add a copy_node method that include type info propagation OR can we rely on type visitor instead by just re-running it in the right places?
FIME subscript type handling list[i], remove is_subscript

TODO golang no if expr
TODO golang mixed types in list/tuple
golang: cannot deref nil, see golang version of test_str_and_None_return in test_func.py

- asttoken token type passing isn't nice
- context.TypeInfo.metadata is not nice
- Clean up assign/for loop logic around storing lhs name? Why go through name method with booleans?

- Java: do not use String.format("%s") for constants
- astrewriter: get rid of wrap
- readlines in python includes terminating \n in each list element?
- builtin module registration is weird, "os.path" has to be repeated
real issues:
    - support conversion methods: str(), int() etc - bonus: remove them if not needed in target language (ie Java converts implicity if lhs is a str, for exampe)

    - elisp: can't use generated ident 't' - need list of reserved identifiers?
    - "\n".join(lines) - \n needs to be escaped \\n
    - elisp: lack of rtn makes it non trivial to translate real code
    - java: in function, every branch must have a return
    - elisp: this should be a single concat call: s2 = "arub" + s[1:-2] + "to"
    - need generalized "result mapping", nil -> -1 for cl-search for example
    - no continue/break in elisp dolist
    - elisp: map code doesn't work - below l1 is treated as a string
          (setq l1 (list 1 2 3))
          (setq d1 #s(hash-table test equal data ("k1" l1)))
    - cannot return the counter variable (scope puller for for loops)
