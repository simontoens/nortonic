Get this working:
1. 
  i = str.find("foo")
  return None if i == -1 else foo[i:].split()[0]

- asttoken token type passing isn't nice
- context.TypeInfo.metadata is not nice
- binop/tuple: need function: ensure_resolved_types
- if/for etc - args vs body, these are currently compared magically:
  num_children_visited == 2 for ex (see scope pushing)
- Clean up assign/for loop logic around storing lhs name? Why go through name method with booleans?
- Functions that return same type as first arg: sorted

- Java: do not use String.format("%s") for constants
- There are a few places in code where we need to know the fields of nodes. Use _fields to make this general or centralize
- Rename strongly_typed to statically_typed
- Rename LanguageSyntax to Language[Definition]?
- astrewriter: get rid of wrap
- elisp "cl-search" (index) does not return -1 but nil
- readlines in python includes terminating \n in each list element?
- builtin module registration is weird, "os.path" has to be repeated


real issues:
    - "\n".join(lines) - \n needs to be escaped \\n
    - elisp: lack of rtn makes it non trivial to translate real code
    - java: in function, every branch must have a return
    - Fix hack in scope.py: _global_ident_node_registry = {}
    - method without args and hardcoded rtn type should not require usage
